## Description

- This web app creates a 3D building on a map canvas (using mapbox-gl) after taking a geojson file as input.
- The web app creates 2 geojson layers (using deck.gl)
- The ground layer depicts the ground floor plan
- The building layer (polygon extrusion) depicts the 3D building
- The building can be tweaked in realtime by varying different properties ( height, plan area, number of floors)

### `NB`

- This app needs a mapbox access token hence you should have an operational mapbox account.
